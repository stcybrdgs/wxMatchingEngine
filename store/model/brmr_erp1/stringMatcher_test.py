spaCy features a rule-matching engine, the Matcher, that operates over tokens,
similar to regular expressions. The rules can refer to token annotations
(e.g. the token text or tag_, and flags (e.g. IS_PUNCT). The rule matcher also
lets you pass in a custom callback to act on matches â€“ for example, to merge
entities and apply custom labels. You can also associate patterns with entity IDs,
to allow some basic entity linking or disambiguation. To match large terminology
lists, you can use the PhraseMatcher, which accepts Doc objects as match patterns.
